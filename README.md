# ML LAB
 
### Week 1: Getting familiarized with basic concepts like data types, data
    frames, control structures, list, tuple dictionary and functions in Python.
### Week 2: Explore python classes and packages related to Machine Learning
    using .CSV file format and use the same format for all programs.
### Week 3: Implement FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific
    hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples.
### Week 4: For a given set of training data examples, implement Candidate 
    Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all consistent hypotheses.
### Week 5: Build FIND-S and Candidate-Elimination algorithm on a different
    data set.
### Week 6: Implement Decision tree for classification of any given data set.
### Week 7: Implement pruning of Decision tree.
### Week 8: Implement an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the
    Back propagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data set.
### Week 9: Implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier and compute the
    accuracy, precision and recall of the classifier, considering appropriate
    data set.
### Week 10: Implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify any given
    data set.
### Week 11: Implement Regression algorithm in order to fit data points.
### Week 12: Implement Radial basis algorithm to classify the given data set
